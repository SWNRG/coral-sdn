CORAL-SDN
Recent proposals enhances Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with Software Defined Networking (SDN) practices, introducing new innovative network control strategies and protocols based on a central control logic, i.e., enabling WSNs as crucial facilities for the Internet of Things (IoT). In this direction, we demonstrate CORAL-SDN, an SDN solution for WSNs which: (i) uses intelligent centralized control mechanisms to adjust dynamically the protocol functionalities; (ii) supports elasticity to the challenging requirements of the WSNs; (iii) maintains a scalable architecture; and (iv) exhibits improved network management and operation in terms of performance and resource utilization. With this demo we provide a suitable environment for hands-on experimentation, featuring the CORAL-SDN protocol operation in real test-beds and highlighting the improvements that SDN brings to IoT.
